        "\n",
        "The **Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequences (LABS)** problem lies at the heart of waveform design for radar and communication systems. Its rugged energy landscape, large symmetry group, and exponential search space make it a challenging benchmark for both classical and quantum optimization methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project implements a **hardware-aware hybrid solver for LABS**, designed around a simple principle:  \n",
        "**use quantum algorithms for global exploration and guidance, and use GPU-accelerated classical search for scalable local refinement**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than attempting to solve LABS directly on quantum hardware, we treat quantum computation as a *seed factory* that produces structured, low-energy candidate solutions. These candidates are then refined by a **Memetic Tabu Search (MTS)** engine that has been explicitly re-engineered to exploit modern GPU architectures.\n",

        "## Architecture Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "Our solver is organized as a multi-stage pipeline that cleanly separates *exploration* from *exploitation*:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Quantum seed generation** produces a diverse pool of promising binary sequences.\n",
        "2. **Classical Memetic Tabu Search** acts as the primary optimization engine, iteratively refining those seeds toward lower-energy configurations.\n",
        "3. **GPU acceleration** is applied to the dominant computational bottleneck of MTS: repeated energy evaluation across large numbers of candidate sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "This separation allows each component to operate where it is most effective:\n",
        "- quantum routines provide **non-local exploration** and bias the search toward favorable regions of the landscape;\n",

        "The quantum component of the pipeline is designed to generate **high-quality initial conditions**, not final answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "We combine multiple quantum techniques to achieve this:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **VQE-based warm-start generation** produces a small number of strong anchor solutions by locally minimizing the LABS Hamiltonian from different initializations.\n",
        "- **Warm-Start QAOA (WS-QAOA)** uses these anchors to generate a large pool of measurement samples that are statistically biased toward lower energies.\n",
        "- **Guided random-walk sampling** is used as an escape mechanism when classical optimization stagnates, injecting new candidates that explore distant regions of the search space.\n",
        "\n",
        "All quantum routines are executed using **CUDA-Q statevector simulation**, where GPU selection and batching strategy are chosen to maximize performance per credit rather than raw peak throughput :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.\n",
        "\n",
        "The output of this stage is a **canonicalized, deduplicated seed population** that feeds directly into the classical optimizer.\n",

        "\n",
        "The classical core of the solver is a **Memetic Tabu Search**, which combines population-based evolution with aggressive local search. While MTS is one of the strongest known heuristics for LABS, its runtime is dominated by repeated energy evaluation during mutation, recombination, and tabu neighborhood scans.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make MTS scalable, we redesign *how* it executes, without changing *what* it does:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Energy evaluation is batched**: energies for many sequences are computed simultaneously as large matrix operations on the GPU.\n",
        "- **Tabu search uses candidate lists**: instead of exhaustively evaluating all single-bit flips, a fixed-size batch of candidate moves is evaluated in parallel and the best admissible move is selected.\n",
        "- **CPU/GPU responsibilities are explicit**:\n",
        "  - the GPU handles dense numerical computation (autocorrelations and energy),\n",
        "  - the CPU manages tabu logic, aspiration rules, population updates, and control flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "This restructuring targets the MTS hot loop directly, converting a sequential, energy-bound algorithm into a **throughput-oriented GPU workload** while preserving the algorithm’s original logic and guarantees :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.\n",

        "- classical heuristics are accelerated where **most of the computation actually occurs**;\n",
        "- GPU resources are allocated to maximize **time-to-solution per dollar**, not theoretical peak performance.\n",
