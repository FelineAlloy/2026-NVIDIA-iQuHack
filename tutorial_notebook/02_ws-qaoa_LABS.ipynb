    "# Hybrid Quantum–Classical LABS Solver  \n",
    "### GPU-Accelerated Memetic Tabu Search with Quantum-Guided Seeding\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequences (LABS)** problem lies at the heart of waveform design for radar and communication systems. Its rugged energy landscape, large symmetry group, and exponential search space make it a challenging benchmark for both classical and quantum optimization methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements a **hardware-aware hybrid solver for LABS**, designed around a simple principle:  \n",
    "**use quantum algorithms for global exploration and guidance, and use GPU-accelerated classical search for scalable local refinement**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than attempting to solve LABS directly on quantum hardware, we treat quantum computation as a *seed factory* that produces structured, low-energy candidate solutions. These candidates are then refined by a **Memetic Tabu Search (MTS)** engine that has been explicitly re-engineered to exploit modern GPU architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solver is organized as a multi-stage pipeline that cleanly separates *exploration* from *exploitation*:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quantum seed generation** produces a diverse pool of promising binary sequences.\n",
    "2. **Classical Memetic Tabu Search** acts as the primary optimization engine, iteratively refining those seeds toward lower-energy configurations.\n",
    "3. **GPU acceleration** is applied to the dominant computational bottleneck of MTS: repeated energy evaluation across large numbers of candidate sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation allows each component to operate where it is most effective:\n",
    "- quantum routines provide **non-local exploration** and bias the search toward favorable regions of the landscape;\n",
    "- classical heuristics perform **intensive local improvement** with high throughput on GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantum-Guided Seeding\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum component of the pipeline is designed to generate **high-quality initial conditions**, not final answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We combine multiple quantum techniques to achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VQE-based warm-start generation** produces a small number of strong anchor solutions by locally minimizing the LABS Hamiltonian from different initializations.\n",
    "- **Warm-Start QAOA (WS-QAOA)** uses these anchors to generate a large pool of measurement samples that are statistically biased toward lower energies.\n",
    "- **Guided random-walk sampling** is used as an escape mechanism when classical optimization stagnates, injecting new candidates that explore distant regions of the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "All quantum routines are executed using **CUDA-Q statevector simulation**, where GPU selection and batching strategy are chosen to maximize performance per credit rather than raw peak throughput :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this stage is a **canonicalized, deduplicated seed population** that feeds directly into the classical optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## GPU-Accelerated Classical Optimization (MTS)\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical core of the solver is a **Memetic Tabu Search**, which combines population-based evolution with aggressive local search. While MTS is one of the strongest known heuristics for LABS, its runtime is dominated by repeated energy evaluation during mutation, recombination, and tabu neighborhood scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make MTS scalable, we redesign *how* it executes, without changing *what* it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Energy evaluation is batched**: energies for many sequences are computed simultaneously as large matrix operations on the GPU.\n",
    "- **Tabu search uses candidate lists**: instead of exhaustively evaluating all single-bit flips, a fixed-size batch of candidate moves is evaluated in parallel and the best admissible move is selected.\n",
    "- **CPU/GPU responsibilities are explicit**:\n",
    "  - the GPU handles dense numerical computation (autocorrelations and energy),\n",
    "  - the CPU manages tabu logic, aspiration rules, population updates, and control flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This restructuring targets the MTS hot loop directly, converting a sequential, energy-bound algorithm into a **throughput-oriented GPU workload** while preserving the algorithm’s original logic and guarantees :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "This project does not claim a standalone quantum advantage. Instead, it demonstrates a **practical hybrid optimization strategy** grounded in realistic hardware constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- quantum algorithms are used where **non-local exploration** is valuable;\n",
    "- classical heuristics are accelerated where **most of the computation actually occurs**;\n",
    "- GPU resources are allocated to maximize **time-to-solution per dollar**, not theoretical peak performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a solver that reflects how near-term quantum and classical resources can be combined today to tackle hard optimization problems more effectively than either approach alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code below to initialize the execution backends and begin exploring the hybrid LABS optimization pipeline.\n"

    "## Building a Quantum Enhanced Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the effectiveness of MTS, it still exhibits exponential scaling  $O(1.34^N)$ behavior and becomes intractable for large $N$.  Quantum computing provides a potential alternative method for solving the LABS problem because the properties of entanglement, interference, and superpositon may allow for a better global search.  Recent demonstrations have even produced evidence that the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) can be used to reduce the scaling of the LABS problem to $O(1.21^N)$ for $N$ between 28 and 40 with quantum minimum finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, current quantum hardware limitations restrict solution to problems of greater than about $N=20$, meaning that it will be some time before quantum approaches can outperform the classical state of the art. It should also be noted that standard QAOA can struggle with LABS and require many layers to converge the parameters if other tricks are not employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of [Scaling advantage with quantum-enhanced memetic tabu search for LABS](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.04553v1) cleverly explored an alternate path that combines quantum and classical approaches and might be able to provide a more near-term benefit.  Instead of expecting the quantum computer to solve the problem entirely, they asked how a quantum approach might enhance MTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that a quantum optimization routine could run first and the resulting state be sampled to produce a better population for MTS. Many such heuristics for defining the initial population are possible, but the rest of this notebook will explore their methodology, help you to build the workflow yourself, and allow you to analyze the benefits of their approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of quantum enhanced MTS (QE-MTS) is to prepare a circuit with CUDA-Q that approximates the ground state of the Hamiltonian corresponding to the LABS problem. You could do this with any optimization algorithm such as QAOA or using an adiabatic approach.  (See the [Quantum Portfolio Optimization](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic/blob/main/quantum-applications-to-finance/03_qchop.ipynb) CUDA-Q Academic lab for a detailed comparison of these two common approaches.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of this work opted for an adiabatic approach (More on why later). Recall that the goal of an adiabatic optimization is to begin with a Hamiltonian that has an easily prepared ground state ($H_i$). Then, the adiabatic Hamiltonian $H_{ad}$ can be constructed as $H_{ad}(\\lambda) = (1-\\lambda)H_i +\\lambda H_f $, where $\\lambda$ is a function of time and $H_f$ is the Hamiltonian representing a qubit encoding of the LABS problem. \n",

    "\n",
    "The challenge for implementing the optimization procedure becomes selection of an operator that will quickly and accurately evolve to the ground state of $H_f$.  One approach is to use a so-called auxiliary countradiabatic (CD) term $H_{CD}$, which corrects diabatic transitions that jump out of the ground state during the evolution. The figure below demonstrates the benefit of using a CD correction.\n",

It also turns out that in the so called impulse regime, where the adiabatic evolution is very fast, $H_{cd} (\\lambda)$ dominates $H_{ad}(\\lambda)$, meaning that the final implementation corresponds to the operator $H(\\lambda) = H^1_{cd}(\\lambda)$ where  $H^1_{cd}(\\lambda)$ is a first order approximation of $A(\\lambda)$ (see equation 7 in the paper).\n",

    "# Verification Report: LABS Problem Solver\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the reliability of our Quantum-Enhanced Memetic Tabu Search (QE-MTS), we implemented a multi-layered validation strategy. This approach verified the correctness of the energy function, the integrity of the solver's logic, and the actual performance advantage provided by the quantum seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Ground Truth Validation (Small $N$ Brute Force)\n",
    "We verified our energy calculation and search logic by comparing results against known global optima for small system sizes ($N=2$ to $N=20$).\n",
    "* **Method:** We utilized a pre-computed list of known optimal energies (e.g., $E=1$ for $N=3$, $E=26$ for $N=20$).\n",
    "* **Result:** Our solver consistently converged to these exact energy values for all tested $N$, confirming that the `compute_energy` function is mathematically correct and the search algorithm is capable of finding global optima.\n",

    "We analyzed the diversity of solutions produced by both the classical and quantum components to understand their behavior.\n",
    "* **Classical MTS:** Verified that random initialization produces a broad spread of starting energies, which narrows as the population converges.\n",
    "* **Quantum (DCQO) Seed:** Visualized the probability distribution of sampled bitstrings. We confirmed that the DCQO circuit does not output a uniform random distribution but instead creates a \"biased\" distribution that concentrates probability mass on low-energy states, validating the counterdiabatic driving mechanism.\n",

    "### 4. Comparative Performance Benchmarking\n",
    "Finally, we implemented a rigorous `run_benchmark` suite to measure the tangible impact of the quantum seed on solver performance.\n",

    "* **Result:** By running side-by-side trials (Classical Random Start vs. Quantum Seed), we observed that the quantum-seeded populations frequently reduced the number of generations required to reach the optimum. This confirms that the quantum circuit provides a high-quality \"warm start\" that effectively bypasses the initial exploration phase of the classical search."

It is quite likely that other classical or quantum heuristics could be used to produce an initial population that might even beat the counteradiabatic method you used, so we cannot make any claims that this is the best. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that mthe point of the counteradiabatic approach derived in the paper is that it is more efficient in terms of two-qubit gates relative to QAOA. The benefits of this regime would only truly come into play in a setting (e.g. larger problem instance) where it is too difficult to produce a good initial population with any know classical heuristic, and the counteradiabatic approach is more efficiently run on a QPU compared to alternatives.\n",

Two interesting conclusions can be drawn from this. First, standard memetic tabu search (MTS) is generally faster than quantum enhanced (QE) MTS.  But there are two promising trends. For larger problems, the QE-MTS experiments occasionally have excellent performance with times to solution much smaller than all of the MTS data points.  These outliers indicate there are certain instances where QE-MTS could provide much faster time-to-solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, if a line of best fit is calculated using the median of each set of medians, the slope of the QE-MTS line is smaller than the MTS!  This seems to indicate that QE solution of this problem scales $O(1.24^N)$ which is better than the best known classical heuristic ($O(1.34^N)$) and the best known quantum approach (QAOA - $O(1.46^N)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "For problems of size of $N=47$ or greater, the authors anticipate that QE-MTS could be a promising technique and produce good initial populations that are difficult to obtain classically. \n",

Future work can explore improvements to both the quantum and classical sides, such as including GPU accelerated memetic search on the classical side."
